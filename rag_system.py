                Hormonal regulation: Leptin decreases with fat loss, increasing hunger. Ghrelin increases appetite. 
                Insulin sensitivity improves with weight loss. Cortisol elevation can impair fat loss.
                
                Effective strategies: High protein intake (1.2-1.6g/kg) preserves muscle mass. Resistance training 
                maintains metabolic rate. Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) regulates appetite hormones. Stress management 
                prevents cortisol-driven fat storage.
                
                Sustainable approach: Gradual calorie reduction, flexible dieting approach, regular refeed days, 
                behavior modification, social support systems."""
