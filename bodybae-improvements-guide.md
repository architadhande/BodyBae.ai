  - Sedentary: BMR √ó 1.2
  - Lightly Active: BMR √ó 1.375
  - Moderately Active: BMR √ó 1.55
  - Very Active: BMR √ó 1.725
  - Super Active: BMR √ó 1.9
- Goal-specific adjustments:
  - **Weight Loss**: -500 calories (0.5kg/week loss)
  - **Toning**: -250 calories (gentle fat loss)
  - **Muscle Gain**: +250 calories (lean gains)

### 3. **Personalized Chat Responses**
The chatbot now recognizes personal questions like:
- "What are my calories?"
- "How many calories should I eat?"
- "What's my TDEE?"
- "Show me my macros"

And provides personalized responses based on user data.

### 4. **New API Endpoint: Nutrition Plan**
Added `/api/nutrition_plan` endpoint that provides:
- Detailed macro breakdown (protein, carbs, fats)
- Meal timing suggestions
- Personalized tips based on goals

## üìù How to Update Your Deployment

### 1. Replace Backend Code
Replace your `app.py` with the updated version that includes:
- `calculate_goal_calories()` function
- Expanded FAQ_KNOWLEDGE dictionary
- Updated activity multipliers
- Enhanced chat response logic

### 2. Update Frontend (Optional)
The frontend updates are minor but improve user_id tracking for personalized responses.

### 3. Test New Features
After deployment, test these queries:
- "What are my calories?" - Should show personalized TDEE and goal calories
- "How much protein do I need?" - Enhanced protein recommendations
- "Tell me about recovery" - New recovery topic
- "How much water should I drink?" - New hydration topic

## üîß Example Chat Interactions

### Before Setting Goal:
**User**: "What are my calories?"
**Bot**: Shows BMR, TDEE based on profile

### After Setting Goal (e.g., Lose Weight):
**User**: "What are my calories?"
**Bot**: Shows BMR, TDEE, Goal, and Target Calories with advice

### General Questions:
**User**: "How do I stay motivated?"
**Bot**: Provides tips on SMART goals, progress tracking, and consistency

## üìä Calorie Calculation Example

For a 30-year-old male, 70kg, 175cm, moderately active:
1. **BMR**: (10 √ó 70) + (6.25 √ó 175) - (5 √ó 30) + 5 = 1,648.75 calories
2. **TDEE**: 1,648.75 √ó 1.55 = 2,555.56 calories
3. **Weight Loss Goal**: 2,555.56 - 500 = 2,056 calories/day

## üöÄ Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Macro Calculator Page**: Add a dedicated page for detailed macro calculations
2. **Progress Tracking**: Store weight updates and show progress graphs
3. **Meal Suggestions**: Based on calorie/macro targets
4. **Exercise Database**: Specific workout recommendations
5. **Water Intake Tracker**: Daily hydration goals

## üìå Important Notes

- All calculations follow scientifically-backed formulas
- The 500-calorie deficit for weight loss = 0.5kg/week loss (safe rate)
- Protein recommendations: 1.6-2.2g/kg based on goals
- Activity multipliers align with standard fitness industry calculations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If personalized responses aren't working:
1. Ensure user_id is being passed in chat requests
2. Check that goal was set after onboarding
3. Verify currentUser object contains all necessary data
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

The improvements maintain the simple, lightweight architecture while significantly enhancing the user experience with personalized nutrition guidance!
